# operator-overloading
## calculate distance between points and determine right angle triangle
<br/>Consider a class “coordinate” that has two private data members xnum and ynum. The data members correspond to points in the positive quadrant of a 2D coordinate space. If the user enters a negative value for any point, convert the point into a positive coordinate point (Hint: Negation operator). Write a C++ program to get three points from the user and check if the length between the three points constitute a right angle triangle. Utilize operator overloading wherever possible (at least four instances). Overloading the negation operator is mandatory.

<br/>The program has the following menu
<br/>Set Point
<br/>Display Point 
<br/>Display Length (Note: Calculates the distance between two points and displays the length)
<br/>Check Right Triangle
<br/>Exit
